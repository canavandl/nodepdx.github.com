Web server development has come a long way in recent years, from having to manage your own room full of servers, to trusting your metal to the “cloud” and later trusting your app itself to PaaS services such as Heroku and AppEngine. 

The next step in that evolution is upon us, and it’s in the form of serverless apps. Building applications not as contained services but rather as isolated handlers that respond to events, actions and requests to your application. Obviously, your app is not really serverless, but the entire infrastructure is offloaded so that developers can focus the majority of their time on app development and even less time on infrastructure.

Tech solutions such as AWS Lambda and API Gateway or Google’s Cloud Functions allow us to develop our applications as a set of “functions” or “lambdas”, essentially handlers that are assigned to events. These events could be anything from network requests (like with API gateway), S3 file changes, queue messages, timed jobs and more. 

The benefit of such an approach is potentially massive, scaling your applications just got a whole lot easier! Starting from the old to the new: when you had your own metal, you had to buy another physical server to scale your operation. When moving to the “cloud”, you had to provision another server and set it up, either manually or automatically. Even with platform solutions like heroku you need to manage your application’s scalability. 

With serverless apps, all issues of infrastructure are completely abstracted from the development process, each function is called when it’s needed by the service provider and can be called as many times as necessary. You don’t have to spin up more servers, worry about provisioning and the theoretical limit of your app is all of AWS’s capacity!
